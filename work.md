                <p>
                    I wanted to keep all my cards in a safe place that I was sure nobody was tracking me or uploading my cards to any server. I decided to build my own solution.<br/><br/>
                    Card Vault is the go-to app if you want to keep all your cards in a single place. You can scan them automatically.
                    It is also saved safely protected with password, FaceID or TouchID.<br/>
                    You can download it on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/card-vault-your-card-wallet/id1378561346?ls=1&mt=8">App Store</a>
