# bpaulino.com blog

Hi there! Welcome to my digital garden. This website is a collection of some of
my experiences.

## Install dependencies

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) based static site generator.  
Make sure you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) 3.2 installed and run
the following commands:

```shell
# If bundler is not there yet, execute:
$ gem install bundler
# Now install all dependencies
$ bundle install
```

## Development and Running locally

Once you have all dependencies installed, you can run the local development
server with:

```shell
# That should kickstart the local dev server
# and make the site available on port 4000 by default for you
jekyll server
# This command should generate an output like this:
Auto-regeneration: enabled for '/the/repo/path/here'
  Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
  Server running... press ctrl-c to stop.
```

## Deployment with Cloudflare Pages ðŸŽ‰

All commits to `master` will trigger an integration with
[Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) where we cache and serve these
contents under my own domain.
