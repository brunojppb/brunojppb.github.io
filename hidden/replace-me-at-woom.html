        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">December 23, 2020</div>
    	<p>I joined <a href="https://woombikes.com/we-are-woom">woom</a> in early 2018 and it has been
a challenging, but very rewarding adventure so far. After almost 3 years working
with a wide range of interesting software projects that allowed us to scale
across the globe, I felt it was time for me to take on a new challenge in a
different field. I’m joining the fantastic Web team at
<a href="https://n26.com/en-at">N26</a> as a Tech Lead of their Core segment next year to
help them change banking for the better and that is pretty exciting.</p>

<p>I’m writing this blogpost to express my gratitude for the amazing woom team and
also to invite you, if you are interested in challenging projects, to replace me
and continue the amazing work we have been doing so far.</p>

  <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This is not a job ad. If you wish to apply, please have a look

<h2 id="about-the-company">About the Company</h2>

<p>woom is still a young company, but it has been quite successful and growing fast
like a rocket since it was founded by
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-ihlenfeld-a13b433/">Marcus Ihlenfeld</a> and
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bezdeka/">Christian Bezdeka</a> in 2013.</p>

<p>Whenever I get the chance to talk about
<a href="https://woombikes.com/we-are-woom">woom</a>, especially for friends who have kids,
I tell them we make <em>“Lamborghini”</em> bikes for kids. I’m not talking about luxury
or pricing here, I am talking about an amazing design and quality which makes
our bikes insanely good. Our mission is to see as many children as possible
loving to ride their bikes, and for that to happen, we have to make damn good
bikes. And to be completely honest, we do a pretty awesome job. Our motto is
<strong>“Think like a child, act like a Pro.”</strong></p>

<p>Our bikes are super light-weight and tailor-made with kids in mind. It isn’t
just an adult bike that was shrunk to fit kids. No, far from that, all the
components are engineered from scratch taking into consideration real-world kids
size, weight and whatnot.</p>

<p>So if you always wanted to work for a company that has a true positive impact in
future generations, woom is definitely a great place for you to be part of. Our
headquarters is located in
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/woom+GmbH/@48.2724804,16.3549515,12.68z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1swoom!3m4!1s0x476d0f409d127629:0x83a3bdb8980c31c2!8m2!3d48.2910947!4d16.343956">Klosterneuburg, directly on the outskirts of Vienna.</a></p>

<h2 id="a-kick-ass-team">A Kick-ass Team</h2>

<p>The whole woom team is distributed across Europe, USA and now it’s expanding to
Asia. But talking about the Tech team specifically, we are four developers, two
project managers, a system admin and a team lead working on different projects,
ranging from internal systems that help to expand our business to our e-commerce
platform that delivers our bikes in several countries and continents.</p>

<p>Besides small projects that help other teams in the company to work with ease,
The developers are working in two high-profile projects:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Odoo ERP system which powers our warehouse. It’s written in Python and
it’s <a href="https://github.com/odoo/odoo">open-source</a></li>
  <li>The e-commerce platform (more about it later on)</li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the main projects that need love the most, so you will probably be
helping on both (mostly on the e-commerce side), either by writing highly
scalable code or contributing to technical decisions that have a big impact on
the future of the business.</p>

<h2 id="the-job">The Job</h2>

<p>I usually describe myself as the <em>Jack-of-all-trades</em> Software Engineer at woom,
but if you like a cooler term, you can call it a <strong>Full-Stack Software
Engineer</strong>. Jokes aside, the job is quite broad and requires strong technical
skills on “how the Web works”, attention to detail and focus on making our
customers happy. With that being said, I still believe that this isn’t the most
important thing we need. Most importantly, <strong>you must be good at people</strong>. We
need someone kind and understanding, that can put themselves in other people’s
shoes and listen to what they have to say. The software you write is meant to
help the people around you, so if you seriously consider the person on the other
side, I’m pretty damn sure you can write good software.</p>

<p>Your responsibilities would be quite broad, but if I could pin-point them, they
would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Primarily focused on our e-commerce platform by writing code, caring about
infrastructure (mostly automated with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>),
monitoring and scalability (More on the tech-stack later).</li>
  <li>Contribute to technical discussions and decisions, even for things unrelated
to the e-commerce platform. After all, you are a Software Engineer that will
be there to support the team on solving challenging problems.</li>
  <li>Define and document internal processes. An example could be <strong>“How to deploy
our e-commerce infrastructure in a new country”</strong> including all the technical
steps necessary to tackle a new market like accepting multi-currency payments,
localization and so on.</li>
  <li>Nice to have:
    <ul>
      <li>Interested in project management, agile and topics related to that.</li>
      <li>Experience with CI and CD. (We use <a href="https://gitlab.com">Gitlab</a>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-tech-stack">The Tech Stack</h2>

<p>Since your primary focus would be on our e-commerce platform, you are probably
interested in its ins and outs. Here is a breakdown of the tech we use at woom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript and TypeScript are our languages of choice.</li>
  <li>MongoDB is our database through
<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas.</a></li>
  <li>Our frontend is written with <a href="https://nuxtjs.org/">Nuxt.js</a> (an isomorphic
framework based on <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js.</a>)</li>
  <li>We use several SaaS platforms that are vital for scalability and growth. Here
the most important ones you will be dealing with on a daily basis:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify</a> as our headless GraphQL e-commerce
platform.</li>
      <li><a href="https://kontent.ai/">Kentico Kontent</a> as our multi-language/multi-country
CMS platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All those services are brought together via a
<a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL API</a> using
<a href="https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/">Apollo Federation.</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> is our cloud provider. We also use
<a href="https://www.hetzner.com/?country=en">Hetzner</a> for some other web
applications.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>If you made it this far and you feel like working with this amazing team, give
it a shot. Even If you don’t check all the boxes for this role, but if you feel
strongly and motivated to work in a fun and friendly company, I would still
encourage you to apply. Our lovely HR team will be happy to review your
application. Finally and above all, we value diversity, so we would love to see
folks from underrepresented groups
<a href="https://woom-gmbh.jobbase.io/">applying for this position.</a></p>
