          <p>
              I've recently joined N26 as a Tech Lead of the Web Core team. I'm still figuring out all the intricacies of the job, but getting the chance to do banking in 2021 is amazing, specially being one of the customers that have suffered for decades with crappy internet banking everywhere I go. N26 is doing an amazing job and being part of it is an awesome opportunity to grow and learn more and more.

              I don't have a cool picture with my team yet, but will update it here as soon as this Covid shitstorm is over.

              Working at woom is a joy and challenging at the same time. We deal with a large scale infrastructure that spams across many continents (EU, North America, Asia) and yet we are still a startup with a very small and efficient team. And c'mon! we make bikes for kids. How cool is it? isn't just cool, it's awesome! 
              <br/><br/>
              On the technical side, I am writing high-scale, cloud-based applications using Scala and the Play framework for high concurrency and high availability for our very international and remote team. I am currently focused on rebuilding our whole international e-commerce experience from scratch using Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo and Vue.js with Nuxt.
              <br/><br/>
              On top of that, I deeply care about soft skills (commonly underrated among the software community), mainly focusing on good communication and putting people first, making sure I can pass the message in an understandable and friendly way, specially for Non-tech-savvy users.

          <p>
              I wanted to keep all my cards in a safe place that I was sure nobody was tracking me or uploading my cards to any server. I decided to build my own solution.<br/><br/>
              Card Vault is the go-to app if you want to keep all your cards in a single place. You can scan them automatically.
              It is also saved safely protected with password, FaceID or TouchID.<br/>
              You can download it on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-vault-lite/id1389892665">App Store</a>
