        <div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">September 1, 2021</div>
    	<p>In this post, we will explore how we can use Redis as a cache layer for our
application and as we explore it further, we will see how a Redis Cluster can
provide us more scalability and reliability.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> If you are already familiar with Redis and it’s just looking for a
way to spin-up a fully configured Redis Cluster using Docker,
<a href="https://github.com/brunojppb/redis-cluster-demo">here is the Github repo.</a>
Just clone this repo, go to your terminal, run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose up</code> and you
should be good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="what-is-redis">What is Redis?</h2>

<p>Redis is a key-value store. In rough terms, it works just like a database, but
it keeps its data in memory, which means that reads and writes are orders of
magnitude faster compared to relational databases like
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL.</a> It is important to mention that Redis
does not replace a relational database. It has its own use-cases and we will
explore some of them in this post.</p>

<p>For more information about Redis, have a look at their website
<a href="https://redis.io/">here.</a> There you find good documentation and how to install
it on your machine. However, we will be building a demo during this post and we
will use an interesting setup using <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and
<a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/">docker-compose</a> that will spin up and
configure the entire Redis cluster for you. The only thing you need available is
Docker.</p>

<h2 id="using-redis-for-caching">Using Redis for caching</h2>

<p>Whenever we need fast access to some sort of data, we need to think about ways
of keeping this data as close to the application layer as possible. If the
amount of data is small enough, It’s generally a good idea to keep this data in
the local memory so we have instant access. But when we talk about web
applications, specially the ones that are stateless and can potentially run in
multiple servers, we can’t guarantee that the data we need will be present as
well as making sure that other servers in your cluster have fast access to this
same data.</p>

<p>That is where databases are handy. We can write this data to a central place and
other servers can fetch this data whenever they need. The issue with some
databases is that if you really need blazing fast access, some of them won’t be
able to deliver that at bullet speed. Redis is generally the go-to database
whenever you need fast and reliable access to specific bits of data. It also
provides us with ways to set expiration policies on that data so they are
deleted automatically when they expire.</p>

<p>Redis is usually a good choice for storing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>User sessions</li>
  <li>Authentication tokens</li>
  <li>Rate-limit counters</li>
</ul>

<p>Redis is by no means limited to the use-cases above, but they fit well when you
need fast data access, most often on every request coming through your servers.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-point-of-using-a-cluster">What is the point of using a cluster?</h2>

<p>It is usually common to start with a single server instance, perhaps connected
to a database server which can take you a long way. But once you need to scale
you application across different countries and sometimes different continents,
it probably means that your application needs to be available 24h a day, 7 days
a week. And robustness and reliability needs to be embedded in your application.</p>

<p>You need to start to think about what happens when one of your database servers
go down, either because of an issue in the network or because of a faulty
hardware. If you have only a single instance you will be dead in the water. If
you have backups, it’s going to take sometime until you can spin up a new
instance, configure it all up to your standards, restore the backup and put it
back in business.</p>

<p>If your application is mission critical, you cannot afford to be offline for a
few hours. Some applications cannot even be offline for a few minutes in the
entire year. This is where a Cluster with replicas can save your skin when a
problem like that happens.</p>

<p>A Redis Cluster makes sure that your data is automatically shared across
multiple Redis instances, which will give you a higher level of reliability and
availability. In case one of those instances experience any kind of failure, the
other nodes can still serve content normally for your application.</p>

<h2 id="spinning-up-a-redis-cluster">Spinning up a Redis cluster</h2>

<p>I’ve recently migrated a large web application from using a single Redis
instance to a cluster with
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/Shards.html">multiple shards</a>,
including multiple replicas. While we are using AWS infrastructure that provides
us the entire cluster configuration, I couldn’t simply trust that everything
would work in production. I had to make sure that we could support a Redis
cluster during development, so I’ve created a setup that spawns several Redis
containers and connect with each other automatically to form a cluster.</p>

<p>To connect to Redis from your application, you will need a library that can
perform that for you (Otherwise you have to reinvent the wheel). While I’ve been
using <a href="https://github.com/luin/ioredis">IORedis</a> for a nodeJS application in
this demo, if you have been using a different language, you will have to look
for different connectors like <a href="https://lettuce.io/">Lettuce for Java</a> or perhaps
<a href="https://github.com/go-redis/redis">go-redis for Go</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The entire setup is ready for you in this
<a href="https://github.com/brunojppb/redis-cluster-demo">Github repository here</a>, so
you don’t have to worry about creating anything from scratch. You can clone it
and give it a spin while we will be walking through the files from this repo
along the rest of this blogpost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="creating-a-dockerfile">Creating a Dockerfile</h3>

<p>While we will be using the standard Redis image available from Dockerhub to spin
up several Redis containers, we still need a way to connect them. That is where
we will be building a special container that can issue commands to Redis in a
way that it can form a cluster.</p>

<p>at
<a href="https://github.com/brunojppb/redis-cluster-demo/blob/main/redis/Dockerfile"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis/Dockerfile</code></a>
we have the following content:</p>

<div class="language-Dockerfile highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">FROM</span><span class="s"> redis:latest</span>

<span class="k">COPY</span><span class="s"> ./entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh</span>
<span class="k">RUN </span><span class="nb">chmod </span>755 /entrypoint.sh

<span class="k">ENTRYPOINT</span><span class="s"> ["/entrypoint.sh"]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will be using this Dockerfile to build our custom Docker image based on
Redis. The secret sauce here is actually in at
<a href="https://github.com/brunojppb/redis-cluster-demo/blob/main/redis/entrypoint.sh"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis/entrypoint.sh</code></a>.
Let’s have a look at this script:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">#!/bin/sh</span>

<span class="c"># Using the redis-cli tool available as default in the Redis base image</span>
<span class="c"># we need to create the cluster so they can coordinate with each other</span>
<span class="c"># which key slots they need to hold per shard</span>

<span class="c"># wait a little so we give some time for the Redis containers</span>
<span class="c"># to spin up and be available on the network</span>
<span class="nb">sleep </span>5
<span class="c"># redis-cli doesn't support hostnames, we must match the</span>
<span class="c"># container IP addresses from our docker-compose configuration.</span>
<span class="c"># `--cluster-replicas 1` Will make sure that every master</span>
<span class="c"># node will have its replica node.</span>
<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"yes"</span> | redis-cli <span class="nt">--cluster</span> create <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.2:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.3:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.4:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.5:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.6:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  173.18.0.7:6379 <span class="se">\</span>
  <span class="nt">--cluster-replicas</span> 1

<span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="s2">"🚀 Redis cluster ready."</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we are using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis-cli</code> to issue commands. This command is creating a
cluster and pointing to the specific Redis instances that will be reachable when
we start this script. we are using hard-coded IP addresses here that will be
provided by our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> file later on.</p>

<p>This cluster is composed by 3 shards. Each shard has a master node that is
responsible for all the writes, but also a Replica node that holds a copy of the
data. A Redis Cluster shard can have up to 500 replicas (at least in AWS). A
Replica node has the power to take over and become the Master node if the
current Master becomes unavailable.</p>

<p>Now notice that inside of our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis</code> folder we also have a file called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis.conf</code>. This file will be copied to each Redis container later on so they
can instruct the Redis instance to work as part of a cluster. Let’s have a look
at its contents:</p>

<div class="language-conf highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Custom config file to enable cluster mode
# on all Redis instances started via Docker
</span><span class="n">port</span> <span class="m">6379</span>
<span class="n">cluster</span>-<span class="n">enabled</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
<span class="c"># The cluster file is created and managed by Redis
# We just need to declare it here
</span><span class="n">cluster</span>-<span class="n">config</span>-<span class="n">file</span> <span class="n">nodes</span>.<span class="n">conf</span>
<span class="n">cluster</span>-<span class="n">node</span>-<span class="n">timeout</span> <span class="m">5000</span>
<span class="n">appendonly</span> <span class="n">yes</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There is not much going on there. The important part is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cluster-enabled yes</code>
which enables our Redis instance to act as part of the cluster. We now need a
way to spin up several Redis containers and make sure that they talk to each
other. At the root folder of our project we have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code>. Let’s
have a look:</p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">volumes</span><span class="pi">:</span>

<p>This is a long one, but here is what this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creates a container with our Express application (just for the sake of this
demo)</li>
  <li>Creates several instances of Redis
    <ul>
      <li>Configure their IP addresses to match the ones used in our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entrypoint.sh</code>
script</li>
      <li>Copy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis.conf</code> file so they can act as a cluster</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Creates a cluster initiator container that is only necessary for executing our
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">entrypoint.sh</code> script and make the cluster connection</li>
  <li>Creates a container with the
<a href="https://github.com/joeferner/redis-commander">Redis Commander UI</a> which is a
nice Web UI for browsing what is stored in our Redis Cluster</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we went through this, let’s try this out. Go to your terminal and
execute:</p>

<div class="language-shell highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker-compose up
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once everything is ready, you should be able to open your browser and visit
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000</code>. There you have a demo web application I’ve built where you can
enter a key/value pair and save it to Redis and also search for a specific key
you have entered before so it can fetch it from Redis and show you the contents
on the screen.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/redis_cluster_demo_web.png" alt="Redis Cluster Demo Web App" /></p>

<p>If you are wondering how the connection is setup on the JavaScript side, let’s
have a look at our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src/service/redisClient.js</code> file.</p>

<p>This part is very simple. It reads the cluster URLs from the environment and
creates an instance of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Redis.Cluster</code> using the RedisIO library. From there on
we can start issue commands like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis.set</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis.get</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redis.exists</code>
across our application. Here is how we do that in the demo Express app within
this repo:</p>

<p>If you would like to explore the data stored in the cluster, go to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost:5000</code> and browse through the Redis Commander UI. There you should be
able see all the Master nodes and explore all keys and values.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/posts/redis_commander_ui.png" alt="Redis Cluster Demo Web App" /></p>

<p>You will notice that some keys are stored in one Master node and other keys are
stored in other nodes. This is the data distribution done by Redis, which
provides you load balancing across the cluster.</p>

<p>I hope this Docker setup can help your development workflow the same way it did
for me and my team recently. Feel free to
