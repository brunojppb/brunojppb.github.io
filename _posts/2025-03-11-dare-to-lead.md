meta_description: Valuable lessons I learned after reading Dare to Lead
---

I spent the past weekend in Vienna visiting friends, and on my flight back to
Barcelona, I finished "Dare to Lead" by Brené Brown. It was both inspiring and
reassuring. Brené goes deep into leadership concepts I've always believed are
essential, especially the power of vulnerability.

One idea that truly resonated with me was one of her definitions of
vulnerability:

> Vulnerability is not a sympathy-seeking tool. It is about being honest with
> the people that can actually help you lead through.

This was a real highlight to me because I’ve always valued honesty, with myself
and with those around me. If there is one thing I have a low tolerance for, it’s
bullshit. Being upfront helps to build trust, and without trust, leadership,
whether at work or in life, becomes an uphill battle.

Another lesson I’m taking with me is what Brené suggests near the end of the
book:

> Make your joy and meaning list and use it to define what success looks like
> for yourself.

This helped me reflect on what truly matters to me and whether I’m living up to
my values. It’s a clear reminder that motivation and growth come from within.
Without that, it’s easy to stagnate.

I highly recommend giving this book a read. It’s a thoughtful guide to leading
with courage, empathy, and purpose.
