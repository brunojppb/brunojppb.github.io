          <p>
              As of February 2021, I've joined N26 as the <strong>Tech Lead</strong> of the Web Core team. Getting the chance to do banking in 2021 is really exciting, specially being one of the customers that have suffered for decades with crappy internet banking everywhere I go. N26 is doing an amazing job and being part of it is an incredible opportunity to grow and learn more and more.

              Working at woom was a joy and challenging at the same time. We deal with a large scale infrastructure that spams across many continents (EU, North America, Asia) and yet we are still a startup with a very small and efficient team. And c'mon! we make bikes for kids. How cool is it? isn't just cool, it's awesome! 
              <br/><br/>
              On the technical side, I am writing high-scale, cloud-based applications using Scala and the Play framework for high concurrency and high availability for our very international and remote team. I am currently focused on rebuilding our whole international e-commerce experience from scratch using Typescript, GraphQL, Apollo and Vue.js with Nuxt.

              I wanted to keep all my cards in a safe place that I was sure nobody was tracking me or uploading my cards to any server. I decided to build my own solution.<br/><br/>
              Card Vault is the go-to app if you want to keep all your cards in a single place. You can scan them automatically.
              It is also saved safely protected with password, FaceID or TouchID.<br/>
              You can download it on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/card-vault-lite/id1389892665">App Store</a>
