meta_description: How legacy projects can teach you valuable lessons
---

I’ve recently read an interesting article
([link](https://www.infobip.com/developers/blog/seniors-working-on-a-legacy-project))
arguing that one can only be considered a senior engineer after navigating at
least one legacy project. And I somewhat agree with this sentiment.

I’ve been around the software industry for a little while now, experiencing
everything from greenfield codebases at early-stage startups to massive,
multi-year enterprise software in large organizations where I was a maintainer.

Reflecting on those experiences, I’ve learned a lot about what went well and
where I failed to anticipate challenges when projects scaled massively. This is
where a critical skill is formed: The power of hindsight and the lessons learned
from past mistakes.

Looking back, it’s sometimes obvious that certain decisions were less than
ideal. But we often forget that, at the time, we lacked the mental tools to
foresee those outcomes. Whether it was underestimating technical debt,
misjudging scalability needs, or not fully grasping maintainability issues,
these lessons only became clear after sticking around long enough to see their
long-term impact.

That’s why I recommend every engineer to stick around for a while. Make
decisions, learn from the consequences, and grow from them. Sure, job-hopping is
a thing in the tech industry, and if a significant pay bump is on the table, go
for it. But if you want to gain the kind of production-grade insights that truly
shape your career, you have to stay long enough to witness the outcome of your
choices. You can't simply speed-run some experiences.

What lessons have you learned by seeing your decisions pan-out over time? Feel
free to send me a message on socials.
