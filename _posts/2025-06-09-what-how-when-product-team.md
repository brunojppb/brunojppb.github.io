meta_description: How to define clear boundaries in an engineering team
---

Ever wondered who owns the "what", "how" and "when" on your Product team?

In a recent chat with a friend who’s a seasoned Product Manager, he was sharing
his struggles with engineering teams in some of his past jobs. We realized that
misaligned expectations between PMs and engineering often come down to unclear
role boundaries. In large orgs, three roles drive a product implementation and
execution forward, but they each own a different piece of the puzzle:

## Product Manager = What

As the voice of the business, you decide what to build next. You set priorities
based on company goals, market needs and ROI. You own the roadmap and the
backlog. You make sure the team is always working on what moves the needle. You
are the authority on what is going to be built.

## Tech Lead = How

You translate that vision into feasible technical solutions. You evaluate
architecture, manage technical debt, select vendors and enforce best practices.
You’re the go-to for code quality, performance and maintainability. You are the
authority on how things should be built.

## Engineering Manager = When

You balance scope, resources and timelines. Your expertise in people management
and capacity planning ensures realistic delivery deadlines. You keep projects on
track by aligning engineers, removing blockers and coaching for growth. You are
the authority here on how the engineering team spends their time.

With this simple "What-How-When" framework, everyone knows exactly who to turn
to. Accountability is crystal clear and collaboration flows. It’s been a
game-changer for me and my teams so far.
